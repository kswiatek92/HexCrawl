## Quiz system

> 🚫 **QUIZZES DISABLED** (set 2026-06-12, by Krzysztof). While disabled, do **not**
> offer/require quizzes, do **not** run quiz rituals, and do **not** gate task pickup or
> phase progression on quiz state. **Preserve all quiz cells as-is** (`⬜`/`🔁`/`🏆`) —
> they are the backlog owed when quizzes are re-enabled. Re-enable only when Krzysztof
> says so (e.g. "enable quizzes"), then remove this banner. Owed on re-enable: task 2.4
> (`⬜`) and every phase summary quiz.

- Every task has a quiz in `QUIZZES.md`. Take it **after** the task is done.
- **Task quiz**: 90% threshold (5-question quiz → need 5/5; 10-question → 9/10).
- **Phase quiz**: 90% threshold. Covers the whole phase. Do not start the next phase until passed.
- How to take a quiz: tell Claude → `"Quiz me on HexCrawl task 1.3"` or `"Quiz me on HexCrawl Phase 1"`.
- Claude asks questions one by one, grades each answer, then gives a full profile assessment: score, weak spots, what to revisit, strong areas.
- If you fail: study what Claude flags, then retry. No skipping forward.

## Pace

**2 hours/day, 5 days/week = 10 hours/week.** (~1 session ≈ 2 hours.)
Vibe coding with AI assistance. Estimates include quiz time and ~20% debugging buffer.
Total: **78 tasks across 6 phases, ~84 sessions, ~17 weeks (~4 months) end-to-end.**

Anchored forward from **2026-06-08**. As of **2026-06-24**: **48/78 tasks done** (Phases 1–3 complete; three CI tasks done early in Phase 6). Remaining: **30 tasks**, ~**8 weeks (~2 months)** → target completion **late August–early September 2026**. Phases 1–3 all closed ahead of estimate — the M3 backend-MVP milestone landed ~2–3 weeks early. (Note: the prior count of "43/77, Phase 3 at 10/15" undercounted Phase 3 by one — the table had 11 done at 3.11; corrected here.)

> ⚠️ Task counts and "done" figures are real (counted from the tables below). The **Sessions / Weeks / Target** columns are estimates, not commitments — adjust as real velocity lands.

## Milestones

Weeks/dates below are **remaining work projected from 2026-06-08** at 10 h/week.

| Milestone | Phase | Tasks (done/total) | Sessions (rem.) | Weeks (rem.) | Target date |
|-----------|-------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| M1 — Domain core | Phase 1 | 19/19 ✅ | — | — | **done** |
| M2 — Data persists | Phase 2 | 11/11 ✅ | — | — | **done** |
| M3 — Playable via API + WS | Phase 3 | 15/15 ✅ | — | — | **done** |
| **M3 = backend MVP** | | | | | **Turn loop over HTTP/WS, scores persist** |
| M4 — Async workers live | Phase 4 | 0/7 | ~9 | ~2 | mid-to-late July 2026 |
| M5 — Browser game playable | Phase 5 | 0/13 | ~14 | ~3 | mid-August 2026 |
| **M5 = playable game** | | | | | **End-to-end in the browser (local)** |
| M6 — Deployed to AWS | Phase 6 | 3/13 | ~14 | ~3 | late August–early September 2026 |
| **M6 = v1 release** | | | | | **Live on AWS ECS Fargate, HTTPS** |

**Key milestones:**

## Phase 5 — React frontend
> Goal: playable browser game. Keep it focused — backend is the star.

| # | Task | Status | Quiz | Who | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-----|-------|
| 5.1 | Vite + React setup | ✅ | ⬜ | K | Zustand + Tailwind v4 + React Router; `/api`+`/ws` dev proxy |
| 5.2 | Design 16×16 pixel tile set | ✅ | ⬜ | K | 🎨 **floor-layout tiles** — wall/floor/stairs/door; GBA-style 4-colour palette; hand-authored via `assets/tools/gen_tiles.py`, seamless, palette-pure |
| 5.3 | Canvas renderer | ✅ | ⬜ | K | 🎨 consumes the 5.2 tile set; draws Floor grid from game state JSON |
| 5.4 | Player sprite + movement animation | 🔲 | ⬜ | K | 🎨 **player sprite** (+ idle/move frames) |
| 5.5 | Enemy sprites (3 types minimum) | 🔲 | ⬜ | K | 🎨 **enemy sprites** — melee / ranged / boss |
| 5.5a | Item sprites (per `ItemType`) | 🔲 | ⬜ | K | 🎨 **item sprites** — potion / weapon / etc.; render on floor grid + HUD inventory (`ItemType` enum, 1.4) |
| 5.6 | `useGameSocket` hook | 🔲 | ⬜ | K | Sends actions, receives state |

| 5.10 | Leaderboard page (global + weekly tabs) | 🔲 | ⬜ | K | 🎨 **page layout** |
| 5.11 | Auth screens (login / register) | 🔲 | ⬜ | K | 🎨 **screen layout** |
| 5.12 | Supabase JWT auth flow | 🔲 | ⬜ | K | |
| 📝 | **Phase 5 quiz** | — | ⬜ | K | Must pass before Phase 6 |

> 🎨 **Design assets needed.** Rows marked 🎨 need pixel art / UI mockups produced (or sourced)
> before the task can be built. All visual design work lives in Phase 5 — Phases 1–4 are pure
> backend logic with no art dependency (the BSP "floor layout" of task 1.13 is *algorithmic*, not visual).
>
> 📋 **Generation shot-list + prompts:** [`docs/art-assets.md`](docs/art-assets.md) — the 13 base
> assets (player/enemies/items/tiles) with ready-to-paste ComfyUI prompts and the shared GBA palette
> ([`docs/palettes/gameboy-4.gpl`](docs/palettes/gameboy-4.gpl)).
>
> 🟢 **Draft sprites generated:** [`assets/`](assets/) holds AI-generated draft sprites named by
> domain enum + [`assets/manifest.json`](assets/manifest.json) for the renderer. 12/13 done; only
> **`tiles/stairs.png` remains** (hand-draw — SD1.5 can't make a staircase tile). A few are `rough`
> (skeleton, armor, door) — see the manifest `status` field.
>
> | Asset | Task | Notes |
> |-------|------|-------|
> | **Floor-layout tiles** — wall, floor, stairs, door | 5.2 → 5.3 | 16×16, GBA 4-colour palette; the visual vocabulary the canvas renders |
> | **Player sprite** (+ idle / move frames) | 5.4 | |
> | **Enemy sprites** — melee, ranged, boss | 5.5 | 3 types min; boss variant ties to "boss every 5th floor" (backlog) |
> | **Item sprites** — potion / weapon / etc. | 5.5a | Render on the floor grid and in the HUD inventory; one per `ItemType` (enum, task 1.4) |
> | **HUD layout** — HP / floor / score / inventory | 5.8 | |
> | **Game over screen** | 5.9 | |
> | **Leaderboard page** — global + weekly tabs | 5.10 | |
> | **Auth screens** — login / register | 5.11 | |

## Backlog / Ideas

### Gameplay
- Boss enemies every 5th floor
- Item shop between floors
- Persistent character unlocks
- Replay system (store action log, replay from seed)
- Discord webhook on new #1 global score
- Mobile touch controls
- **Speed / Luck stats on `Player`** (turn-order resolution + crit / loot RNG) — deferred from v1, which ships with HP / Attack / Defense only

### CI / Quality pipelines (suggested — not yet scheduled)
- **`import-linter` in CI** — fail the build if anything inside `src/domain/` or `src/application/` imports a forbidden framework (fastapi/sqlalchemy/redis/celery/pydantic). This automates the golden hexagonal rule that `/audit` checks manually.
- **CodeQL** (`github/codeql-action`) — weekly + on PR; covers Python and JS/TS security patterns for free on public repos.
- **Semgrep** — more targeted rulesets (e.g. flask/fastapi auth checks) than CodeQL.
- **Trivy image scan** — once the FastAPI and Celery Dockerfiles exist (Phase 6 tasks 6.1 / 6.2), scan built images for CVEs on every push to `main`.
- **Alembic head-check** — `alembic heads | wc -l == 1` as a CI step once migrations exist, to prevent conflicting heads from slipping into `main`.
- **WebSocket smoke test** — spin up the full compose stack in CI and hit `/ws/game/{session_id}` with a canned turn sequence; catches wiring regressions unit tests miss.
- **Load test on leaderboard endpoints** — `k6` or `locust` scheduled weekly against a staging deploy; the endpoint has a latency budget per `QUIZZES.md` Phase 3 summary quiz.
- **Coverage trend publishing** — upload `coverage.xml` to Codecov / Coveralls so PRs show coverage diff, not just pass/fail on the 80% threshold.
- **Release / tag workflow** — on version tag, build + push Docker images to ECR (once Phase 6 task 6.10 lands).
- **Preview deploys for PRs** — spin up a per-PR environment; optional, costs money on AWS, cheap on Fly.io or Render.
- **Mutation testing** (`mutmut` for Python, `stryker` for TS) — optional but a strong signal for the domain layer where correctness matters most; would run on a schedule, not every PR.
