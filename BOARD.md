## Quiz system

> 🚫 **QUIZZES DISABLED** (set 2026-06-12, by Krzysztof). While disabled, do **not**
> offer/require quizzes, do **not** run quiz rituals, and do **not** gate task pickup or
> phase progression on quiz state. **Preserve all quiz cells as-is** (`⬜`/`🔁`/`🏆`) —
> they are the backlog owed when quizzes are re-enabled. Re-enable only when Krzysztof
> says so (e.g. "enable quizzes"), then remove this banner. Owed on re-enable: task 2.4
> (`⬜`) and every phase summary quiz.

- Every task has a quiz in `QUIZZES.md`. Take it **after** the task is done.
- **Task quiz**: 90% threshold (5-question quiz → need 5/5; 10-question → 9/10).
- **Phase quiz**: 90% threshold. Covers the whole phase. Do not start the next phase until passed.
- How to take a quiz: tell Claude → `"Quiz me on HexCrawl task 1.3"` or `"Quiz me on HexCrawl Phase 1"`.
- Claude asks questions one by one, grades each answer, then gives a full profile assessment: score, weak spots, what to revisit, strong areas.
- If you fail: study what Claude flags, then retry. No skipping forward.

## Pace

**2 hours/day, 5 days/week = 10 hours/week.** (~1 session ≈ 2 hours.)
Vibe coding with AI assistance. Estimates include quiz time and ~20% debugging buffer.
Total: **77 tasks across 6 phases, ~84 sessions, ~17 weeks (~4 months) end-to-end.**

Anchored forward from **2026-06-08**. As of **2026-06-19**: **35/77 tasks done** (Phases 1 & 2 complete; Phase 3 at 2/15; three CI tasks done early in Phase 6). Remaining: **42 tasks**, ~**11 weeks (~2.5 months)** → target completion **late August–mid-September 2026**. Phase 2 closed ahead of its late-June estimate.

> ⚠️ Task counts and "done" figures are real (counted from the tables below). The **Sessions / Weeks / Target** columns are estimates, not commitments — adjust as real velocity lands.

## Milestones

Weeks/dates below are **remaining work projected from 2026-06-08** at 10 h/week.

| M1 — Domain core | Phase 1 | 19/19 ✅ | — | — | **done** |
| M2 — Data persists | Phase 2 | 11/11 ✅ | — | — | **done** |
| M3 — Playable via API + WS | Phase 3 | 2/15 | ~15 | ~3 | mid-to-late July 2026 |
| **M3 = backend MVP** | | | | | **Turn loop over HTTP/WS, scores persist** |
| M4 — Async workers live | Phase 4 | 0/7 | ~9 | ~2 | early August 2026 |
| M5 — Browser game playable | Phase 5 | 0/12 | ~14 | ~3 | late August 2026 |
| **M5 = playable game** | | | | | **End-to-end in the browser (local)** |
| M6 — Deployed to AWS | Phase 6 | 3/13 | ~14 | ~3 | mid-September 2026 |

## Backlog / Ideas

### Gameplay
- Boss enemies every 5th floor
- Item shop between floors
- Persistent character unlocks
- Replay system (store action log, replay from seed)
- Discord webhook on new #1 global score
- Mobile touch controls
- **Speed / Luck stats on `Player`** (turn-order resolution + crit / loot RNG) — deferred from v1, which ships with HP / Attack / Defense only

### CI / Quality pipelines (suggested — not yet scheduled)
- **`import-linter` in CI** — fail the build if anything inside `src/domain/` or `src/application/` imports a forbidden framework (fastapi/sqlalchemy/redis/celery/pydantic). This automates the golden hexagonal rule that `/audit` checks manually.
- **CodeQL** (`github/codeql-action`) — weekly + on PR; covers Python and JS/TS security patterns for free on public repos.
- **Semgrep** — more targeted rulesets (e.g. flask/fastapi auth checks) than CodeQL.
- **Trivy image scan** — once the FastAPI and Celery Dockerfiles exist (Phase 6 tasks 6.1 / 6.2), scan built images for CVEs on every push to `main`.
- **Alembic head-check** — `alembic heads | wc -l == 1` as a CI step once migrations exist, to prevent conflicting heads from slipping into `main`.
- **WebSocket smoke test** — spin up the full compose stack in CI and hit `/ws/game/{session_id}` with a canned turn sequence; catches wiring regressions unit tests miss.
- **Load test on leaderboard endpoints** — `k6` or `locust` scheduled weekly against a staging deploy; the endpoint has a latency budget per `QUIZZES.md` Phase 3 summary quiz.
- **Coverage trend publishing** — upload `coverage.xml` to Codecov / Coveralls so PRs show coverage diff, not just pass/fail on the 80% threshold.
- **Release / tag workflow** — on version tag, build + push Docker images to ECR (once Phase 6 task 6.10 lands).
- **Preview deploys for PRs** — spin up a per-PR environment; optional, costs money on AWS, cheap on Fly.io or Render.
- **Mutation testing** (`mutmut` for Python, `stryker` for TS) — optional but a strong signal for the domain layer where correctness matters most; would run on a schedule, not every PR.
